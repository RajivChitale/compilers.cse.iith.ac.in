### Abstract

There is a growing interest in enhancing compiler optimizations with ML models, yet interactions between compilers
and ML frameworks remain challenging. Some optimizations require tightly coupled models and compiler internals,
raising issues with modularity, performance and framework
independence. Practical deployment and transparency for
the end-user are also important concerns. We propose MLCompiler-Bridge to enable ML model development within
a traditional Python framework while making end-to-end integration with an optimizing compiler possible and efficient.
We evaluate it on both research and production use cases, for
training and inference, over several optimization problems,
multiple compilers and its versions, and gym infrastructures.
